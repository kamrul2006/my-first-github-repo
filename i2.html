        Early fatwas and criticisms of the mawlid have taken issue with the "possibility of coerced giving" as hosts often took monetary contributions from their guests for festival costs.</p>

    <p>Jurists often conceptualized the observance of Muhammad's day of birth as a "form of reciprocation for God's bestowal of the Prophet Muhammad" as a way of justifying celebrations.[95][page needed] According to this thought, the bestowal of such a gift required thanks, which came in the form of the celebration of the mawlid.</p>

 <p>Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (1392 CE) and Ibn Hajar         al-Asqalini (1449 CE) both expressed such ideas, specifically referencing the hadith about the Jews and the fast of ‘Ashura’, but broadening the conception of "thanks to God" to multiple forms of worship including prostration, fasting, almsgiving, and Qur’anic recitation.[95][page needed] The only limitation Ibn Hajar places on forms of celebration is that they must be neutral under Shari’a.</p>
